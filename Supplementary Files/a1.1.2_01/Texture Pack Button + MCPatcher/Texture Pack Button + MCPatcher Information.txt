Farn (farnfarn02 on Discord) modded Alpha v1.1.2_01 to add a texture pack button to the game alongside with MCPatcher from Beta 1.7.3.

Unlike the original MCPatcher, this one is intentionally trying not to edit the Minecraft.class file
V2 of the mod fixed broken block transparency after entering the Texture Pack menu, and added Texture Pack saving.
