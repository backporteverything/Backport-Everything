MCPatcher (previously known as HD texture fix) cover version 2.0.0 for Beta 1.5.

2.0.0-beta4 onwards requires a little work to patch texture packs. Below are the extra steps:
- Download the lwjgl.zip
- Make 'folder'
- Make 'bin' folder inside of 'folder'
- Put minecraft.jar and lwjgl.jar (inside lwjgl.zip) into bin
- Select 'folder' when MCPatcher asks you to select Minecraft directory
