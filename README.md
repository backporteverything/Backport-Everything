**Backport Everything** attempts to convert modern Minecraft textures into older versions!

If you want to see what older versions look like with new textures, _this is the pack for you_. Test them out on older versions for a laugh, or start an alpha or beta survival world for a simpler time.

Currently updated for **1.21.11 textures**, this pack aims to bring modern versions to older ones. Currently, the pack **supports versions 1.20.1 and older**, dating back to the first version in 2009 with the pre-classic build rd-132211, which features only grass and cobblestone.

There are other packs available, such as [MC New Textures](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/mc-new-textures), [Modernity](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/modernity) and [Modern Textures](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/modern-textures), but I find that they either miss out some textures (e.g. leather armour, fast leaves) or don't support the beta and alpha versions. This texture project is also available to download on Modrinth if you prefer, [click here for a link](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/backport-everything).

A couple of the things that this pack supports:
- Backported 1.21.11 textures to all versions
- New redstone repeater, comparator & torch (1.20.1 to 1.8)
- HD ghast texture from 1.21.6 (1.20.1 to 1.6.1)
- HD Minecraft logo (1.20.1 to b1.8)
- Unique spawn egg textures (1.20.1 to 1.8, OptiFine required before 1.13)
- Wolf colour variants (1.20.1 to 1.8, OptiFine/Entity Texture Features required)
- Bush texture (1.20.1 to 1.8)
- Tall & short dry grass textures (1.20.1 to 1.8)
- [The Aether](https://modrinth.com/mod/aether) (b1.7.3 & 1.2.5) and [Aether on Station API](https://modrinth.com/mod/aether-stapi) (b1.7.3)

A few things this pack doesn't support at the moment:
- New music released after 1.21.1, check out [Tunes : Backport](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/tunes-backport) by wasabliss. I'd add it, but the zip file size would be huge.
- [Horse](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/horse-backport), [vex](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/vex-backport), [bat](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/bat-backport) & [zombie piglin](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/zombie-piglin-backport) model backports, see Scutoel's packs linked. I'm not smart enough to make entity models, but there are converted textures for each mob using the old version's models.
- Bogged models, see [Bogged Backport](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/bogged-backport) by realllyrandommann.
- [Leaf litter](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/leaf-litter-backport) and [wildflowers](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/wildflowers-backport), see ludo_silver_'s packs linked. Not added, as they are a little janky since they don't work as a standalone block, but they are an alternative grass texture.

This was a fun little project, but there are **probably a few texture issues here and there** from the conversion. If you notice any problems and are willing to let me know, please email [backporteverything@gmail.com](mailto:backporteverything@gmail.com), and I'll address the issue. See below for a list of known bugs which will get fixed soon™.

OptiFine 1.7.2 and newer [can be found here](https://optifine.net/downloads). For archived versions of OptiFine, MCPatcher, and additional files, please refer to the Supplementary Files folder on GitHub. If you have any other suggestions for mods, feel free to email me.

Big thank you to Julien Kerboeuf for creating the [Minecraft Resource Extractor](https://github.com/JKerboeuf/Minecraft-Resource-Extractor). It definitely helped speed up a lot of the tedious parts. Thank you also to the Mojang Art Director [JAPPA](https://x.com/JasperBoerstra) for the texture update for 1.14! 

## Installing texture packs for versions 1.5.2 to Alpha v1.2.6
Texture packs are natively supported for these versions, making installation relatively easy.
1. Run Minecraft, click the Texture Packs (1.1/1.0) or Mods and Texture Packs (b.1.8.1 and earlier) button in the main menu.
2. Click the Open Texture Pack Folder button. This will open the folder where the texture packs can be installed.
3. Drag the Backport Everything texture pack into the folder, and it should appear in Minecraft after a few seconds.
4. Select the texture pack, and now it's applied and ready to go.

## Installing texture packs for Alpha v1.2.5 and earlier
**Texture packs are not supported natively before Alpha v1.2.2**, but earlier versions can have their textures swapped out using a jar mod. I don't _really_ know why you'd want to play those versions, but it's funny to see them working with the latest textures.

Just a note, rd-20090515 kept crashing for me on launch, and so I can't test it. But since it's just 13 textures, you won't be missing much if you can't run it yourself.

To add textures to old versions that don't support texture packs, you'll need to add them as a jar mod using [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) or [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/). They're pretty much the same, but Prism Launcher has fancy extra features.

1. Download the ZIP file for the version of Minecraft you want to change. You'll need it for later.
2. Download and install either [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) or [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/); take your pick.
3. Open either Prism or MultiMC, log in to your Microsoft account and then click the 'Add Instance' button in the top-right corner.
4. In the 'Custom' (Prism) or 'Vanilla' (MultiMC) section, on the right-hand side, tick the checkboxes for 'Betas' and 'Alphas' in the filter list.
5. Scroll down to the version you want to play, select it and click the OK button in the bottom-right.
6. Once you've clicked OK, an icon will appear for the version you selected. Right-click on the icon and click 'Edit...' (Prism) or 'Edit Instance' (MultiMC).
7. Go to the 'Version' tab if you're on Prism Launcher.
8. Once you're on the version tab, you should see a list of actions on the right-hand side. Click the button that says 'Add to Minecraft.jar'
9. A new window should appear, locate the Backport Everything file, select it and open it.
10. The jar mod should now be installed. You can then launch the version of Minecraft, and the new textures should work!
